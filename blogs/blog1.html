<h2 class="fade-in">1. Stick to the PRC Syllabus</h2>
<p class="fade-in">Always align your review plan with the latest PRC outline. Avoid wasting time on low-priority areas.</p>

<h2 class="fade-in">2. Master the Core Subjects</h2>
<p class="fade-in">Give priority to Structural, Hydraulics, Geotech, and Math. These carry the most weight.</p>
<div class="tip fade-in">✅ Tip: Create a mini scoreboard to track scores in mock exams per subject.</div>

<h2 class="fade-in">3. Take Timed Mock Exams</h2>
<p class="fade-in">Simulation is key. Use the CE Randomizer to take timed tests weekly.</p>
<div class="warning fade-in">⚠️ Warning: Don’t cram. Final week should be for recall—not first-time learning.</div>

<h2 class="fade-in">4. Organize Your Notes Visually</h2>
<p class="fade-in">Use color-coded formulas, sketch-based mnemonics, or anchor diagrams to help you recall key concepts.</p>

<h2 class="fade-in">5. Trust Your Process</h2>
