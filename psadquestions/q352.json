  "situation": "A cylinder having a diameter of 1.20m and weighing 800N is held in position in sea water by a wire tied to an anchor block resting at the bottom of the sea such that 0.30m of the cylinder is below the surface of the water with its axis vertical. The anchor block has a volume of 0.50 cubic meter and weighs 24 kN per cubic meter in air. Assume sea water to have a specific gravity = 1.03. Neglecting the weight and volume of the cable,",
