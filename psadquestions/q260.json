  "situation": "If a scuba diver goes to depths greater than 33 feet, the function $T(d)= \\frac{1700}{d-33}$ gives the maximum time a diver can remain down and still surface at a steady rate with no decompression stops. In this function $T(d)$ represents the dive time in minutes, and d represents the depth in feet. If a diver is planning a 45 â€“ minute dive, what is the maximum depth the diver can go without decompression stops on the way back up?",
