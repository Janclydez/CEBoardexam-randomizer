  "situation": "A 6m long prestressed cantilever beam carries a concentrated live load of 18kN at the free end and a uniform dead load due to its own weight. The unit weight of concrete is 20kN/m<sup>3</sup>. The strands are 12mm in diameter with total prestressing force of 540kN applied at an eccentricity \"e\" above the neutral axis of the gross-section. The beam has a width of 400mm and a total height of 600mm.",
