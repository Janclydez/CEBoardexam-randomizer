  "situation": "The weight that can be safely supported by a beam with a rectangular cross section varies directly as the product of the width and square of the depth of the cross section and inversely as the length of the beam. If a 2-inch by 4-inch beam that is 8 feet long safely supports a load of 500 pounds, what weight can be safely supported by a 2-inch by 8-inch beam that is 10 feet long? (Assume that the width is the shorter dimension of the cross section.)",
