  "situation": "The three reservoirs A, B and C are connected by pipelines 1, 2 and 3, respectively, which meet at junction D as shown in the figure. The elevation of reservoir A is at 300 m, while that of C is at elevation 277 m. The discharge flowing towards B is 0.60 m<sup>3</sup>/sec. The length diameter and frictiom factors for the pipes are as shown in the accompanying table.",
