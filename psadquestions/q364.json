  "situation": "A vessel has an orifice located on the vertical side of a vessel under a constant head of h meters. The jet issuing from the orifice strikes the ground 12m below the center of the orifice at a point 20m distance, measured horizontally, from the vertical plane of the orifice. If the coefficient of velocity of orifice is 0.98 and neglecting air resistance on the jet.",
