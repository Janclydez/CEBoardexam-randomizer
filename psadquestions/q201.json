  "situation": "A contractor operates Smallvilleâ€™s recycling center. Part of the incineration equipment is not working up to the original specifications, and the question is how much (if any) of a fix should be made now. That part of the facility is scheduled for a complete rebuild in 4 years. The quick-fix (A) approach works pretty well for the first year, saving P4000, but each year, the savings fall by P1000. Quick-fix (A) approach costs P7000.\nThe quality-fix (B) approach solves the problem for 4 years, with a savings of P4300 per year. Quality-fix\n(B) approach costs P12,000.<br>\nSmallville uses an interest rate of 10%. Which approach is better and by how much?<br>\n\nGradient series factor: (A/G, 10%, 4) = 1.3812<br>\n\nUniform series capital recovery factor: (A/P, 10%, 4) = 0.31547<br> Uniform series compound amount factor: (F/A, 10%, 4) = 4.6410\n",
