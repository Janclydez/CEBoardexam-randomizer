  "situation": "Engineers are often required to determine the stress on building materials. Tensile stress can be found by using the formula below.<br>In this formula, T represents the tensile stress, t represents the tension, c represents the compression, and p represents the pounds of pressure per square inch. If the tensile stress is 108 pounds per square inch, the pressure is 50 pounds per square inch, and the compression is -200 pounds per square inch, what is the tension?",
