  "situation": "A 400 mm√∏ pipeline discharges water and branches into 3 pipes at junction A. The first pipe has a diameter of 300 mm, and length of 3000 m, the 2nd pipe has a diameter of 200mm and length of 1300m, and the third pipe has a diameter of 250mm and length of 2600 m. These 3 pipes then merge together at junction B to form a single pipeline having a diameter of 400 mm. Headloss between junction A and B = 24 m. Assume C = 120.",
