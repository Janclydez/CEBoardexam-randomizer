The properties of the column are the following:<br>\nA=8129mm²<br>\nIx=178.3x106mm⁴<br>\nIy=18.8x106mm⁴<br>\nfy=345MPa<br>\nE=200000MPa<br>\n\nProportional Limit: fs=320MPa<br>\n\nThe x-axis has an unbraced length of 8m, which is pinned at the top and fixed at the bottom with K=0.7 to prevent sidesway. The y-axis has an unbraced length of 4m due to the bracing at the mid-height.",
