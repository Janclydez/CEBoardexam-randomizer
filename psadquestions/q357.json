  "situation": "In order to provide irrigation, water has to be pumped to an elevation 120m from 60m through a common pipe where the pressure required at the higher elevation is 172kPa. The source of the water and the discharge point are at atmosphere pressure. Irrigation requirements dictate that water must be pumped at the rate of 1m<sup>3</sup>/s. The loss of head due to friction and other factors is estimated to be 2.45 m.",
