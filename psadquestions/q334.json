  "situation": "A water tank has a sloping inclined at 45Â° with the horizontal. The total depth of water in the tank is 6.7 m.\nA water jet issues from an orifice located on the inclined side of the tank under a hydrostatic head of 4 m.\nor that orifice is located 2.7 m. vertically above the bottom of the tank. Coefficient of velocity is 1.0.\nNegcting air resistance on the jet.",
