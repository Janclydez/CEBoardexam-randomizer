  "situation": "The common tangent AB of a compound curve is 76.42m with an azimuth of 268º30', the vertex V being inaccessible. The azimuth of the tangents AV and VB was measured to be 247º50'; and 282º50' respectively. The stationing at A is 10+010.46 and the degree of the first curve is 4º based on the 20m chord. Use chord basis.",
