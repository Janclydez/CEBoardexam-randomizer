  "situation": "The section of a prestressed hollow core slab is shown. The slab is simply supported over a span of 7.5m and carries a superimposed dead load of 3kPa and live load of 5kPa. The total prestressing force is 1400kN at an eccentricity of 40mm. The properties of the section are as follows:<br>Cross-sectional area = 160x10<sup>3</sup>mm<sup>2</sup><br>Moment of inertia, I<sub>x</sub>=350x10<sup>6</sup>mm<sup>4</sup><br>Unit weight of concrete = 23.5kN/m<sup>3</sup>",
