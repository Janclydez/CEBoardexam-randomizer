  "situation": "A beam has a width of 300mm and a total depth of 550mm. The beam has a length of 8m and is fixed at both ends. It is reinforced with 3-28mm⌀ bars at the tension side and 2-25mm⌀ bars at the compression side. Using a steel cover of 70mm, fc'=21MPa, fy=276MPa. Use 24kN/m<sup>3</sup> as unit weight of concrete.<br>Superimposed Dead Load = 8kN/m<br>Live Load = 12 kN/m<br>Using alternate design method.",
