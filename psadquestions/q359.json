  "situation": "A triangular gate or height 1.2m and base 0.9m is installed in a position that its plane is inclined 60 degrees with the horizontal with its vertex at the top and the base parallel to the water surface. The vertex is at a depth of 2m vertically below the water surface. Fresh water is on one side of the gate.",
